# Car Evaluation Classifier

This repository contains a Python project that applies a rule-based classification method on a car evaluation dataset. The dataset includes various attributes of vehicles such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, seating capacity, luggage boot size, and safety features. Based on these attributes, vehicles are classified into four different classes: 'unacc', 'acc', 'good', and 'vgood'.

## Attributes

- `buying`: vhigh, high, med, low
- `maint`: vhigh, high, med, low
- `doors`: 2, 3, 4, 5more
- `persons`: 2, 4, more
- `lug_boot`: small, med, big
- `safety`: low, med, high

## Classes

- `unacc`
- `acc`
- `good`
- `vgood`
